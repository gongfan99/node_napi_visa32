# node_napi_promise_example
An node extension example with napi for promise

# Introduction
This is a simple example for node native extension with napi. It asynchronously multiplies two numbers and outputs the result.

This is to give everybody a starting point to work on because I could not find a complete example for promise implementation with napi.

It has been tested on my Win7 local machine.
